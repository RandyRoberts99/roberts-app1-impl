# To Do List Application Quick Guide

Hello! This is a guide on how to use my to-do-list app! Let's get started!

The List:
A list can store 100 items, the application will not let you add more than that.

Items:
An item can store a description between 1-256 characters in length.
An item can have an optional date from the Georgian Calendar.
An item can be marked as complete or incomplete.

Controls:
In order to use any of the controls provided, a list must be loaded or created.
To add a new list, click the "New" button in the Files tab, or the "Load" button
in the Files tab to create/load a list. Once created, the user can Add a new item
to the list, Edit or View an item in the list, Delete an item from the list, 
Clear the list entirely, or filter the list by Completed/Incomplete. (Note, while
filtering the user cannot access most controls, and must unfilter the list to re-access most controls.)

That's the basic rundown of my program, thanks for taking a look!
